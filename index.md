# i really enjoy going to school at CSUF very fun!!!
graduate 2017

Lab 1 
I enjoyed lab one because of the introduction to the course. It expanded my mind to this whole idea of coding. It was unique and fun because it was my first day of college, and I greatly enjoyed it. Also, typing hello world was fun.

Lab 3 part 1
This was by far the most difficult lab for me because of the jump in difficulty. My partner didn't let me get the hang of coding, which set me back a lot it was hard for me to catch up, but it was a fun experience finding the unit price of the pizza.

Lab 8 part 1 
This coding experience was very fun because of the arguments that i had to type instead of doing it the long way. I would prefer to have had a better teammate but life is not fair. IT was cool because you entered like a menu genuinely felt proud of myself for once.
